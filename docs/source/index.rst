PhishBench |release|
======================================

PhishBench is a extendable framework for benchmarking phishing detection systems designed to let researchers easily
evaluate new features and classification approaches by comparing their effectiveness against existing methods from the
literature. It offers evaluation metrics and methods suitable for imbalanced datasets and includes a rich variety of
algorithms for detection or classification problems. It includes 250 features gleaned from the phishing
detection literature published since 2010, and allows users to easily define new features for testing.
