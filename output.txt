Dear Mesfer



I need you to clarify the following regarding the attached document.



1.      
Is the stamp on the document for the tax authority in Italy or for HT.
2.      
If it is for the tax authority then document B will not be needed but the form needs attestation from the embassy. We should have
 the original document.
3.      
HT should stamp its part of the document as well.

Dear Mesfer



DZIT rules for refunding WT is as follows:



1-     
The based paying entity (TCC) required  to deduct shall have to deduct the tax and pay back to the Department according to provisions and prices provided in the Tax Law.



2-     
If the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements entered into with the Kingdom shall grant the beneficiary (Hacking Team) an exemption or discount in relation to the deduction
 tax stipulated in the Tax Law, the deducting entity (TCC) shall have to provide the Department of Zakat and Income Tax a letter requires therein to refund the deducted overpaid amount provided, the letter should be attached by the following:



A.     
A letter from the beneficiary (Hacking Team) based in the other country requesting therein to refund the overpaid amounts.

B.     
A certificate issued by the Tax Department of such country wherein the beneficiary (Hacking Team) is residing, stating that, the beneficiary of the paid amount is residing
 under the provisions of article four of the agreement with such country, and that the amount paid thereto shall be taxable in its country.

C.     
A copy of the deduction form whereby, the tax was provided along with the receipt that approves the payment by the deducting entity to the Department of Zakat& Tax Income.



3. After the above mentioned is received and the paying person (Hacking Team) is verified to enjoy the conditions
 stated in the agreement so as to get domain.com from the provisions of the agreement, the Department shall refund the overpaid amount according to the procedures stated in the Department Circulation No. 3334/9, dated 16/06/1427 H.



To clarify more :



1.      
TCC deducted 15% from HT payments. The agreement Between Italy and Saudi Arabia allows 10% deduction instead of 15%. Therefore HT is eligible to claim refund of 5% only
 not the full 15% that was deducted.

2.      
In addition to the form provided in your email, HT is required to domain.com the documents A, B, and C . (All the above documents A, B, and C are preferably to be authenticated
 by the embassy)

Still working on getting a third speaker, updated NJ teachers script, plus a third set below (I'm really trying to get a woman as the third person)

Assemblyman Diegnan

Hi everyone and thank you for joining the call. This is Assemblyman Pat Diegnan, and I serve as the Chair of the Education Committee.

It has certainly been a busy week in Trenton and nationally as well, with Donald Trump spouting another conspiracy theory and all but certain to secure the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz dropping out, and our governor generating buzz as a possible Trump vice presidential pick.

During this Teacher Appreciation Week, we wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the Republican record on education locally and at the national level.

Governor Christie's behavior toward teachers and public employees for the past six years has been disgraceful. Over and over again, he has tried to devalue the teaching profession and squeeze those who work so hard to shape our children's future. He actually suggested last year that teachers should be making minimum wage<<<link>>>, after he vetoed and stood against<<<link>>> minimum wage increases.

And he is supporting and actively campaigning for Donald Trump, who is similarly destructive. Trump has said that he would reduce union power and has vowed to cut the Department of Education.

How is that for investing in New Jersey's future? And our state has resoundingly rejected these wrong-headed policies, Governor Christie's approval ratings have plummeted to 26 percent since he endorsed Trump.

These issues haven't gotten much attention because of the GOP's numerous, other outrageous comments. The Republican party agenda is so extreme that those backward education proposals are the standard now.

As New Jersey has wrestled with the consequences of Governor Christie's actions and hostility, we cannot allow his policies to spread across the country at the prospect of a Republican president.

Now, I would like to introduce someone who has always been a champion of educators, NJEA President Wendell Steinhauer.

Wendell Steinhauer

Hi everyone, and thank you Assemblyman. As some of you may know, I taught in the Riverside public schools for 27 years. In my time at the NJEA, I've seen first-hand Chris Christie at work.

This week is Teacher Appreciation Week, and Governor Christie has been anything but appreciative of teachers and our work his entire tenure in office. We all remember when he slashed the state education aid by more than $1 billion in his first year in office, leading to thousands of layoffs.

Or when he made reneged on his promise to fund public employee pensions, despite his promise to do so at the negotiation table.

Or when he suggested violence against teachers and teachers unions; he has made multiple references to punching us.

It is certainly no surprise to us that Chris Christie is supporting Donald Trump for President, they are two peas in pod. But when it comes to teachers, we cannot allow what Governor Christie has done to New Jersey to spread to the rest of the country, especially now that Trump is the standard bearer of the Republican party.

Trump is on record for saying that he would cut the Department of Education and that he would reduce the power of the teachers' unions.

We simply can't imagine what would happen under this Republican president, where Governor Christie's dangerous ideas and policies would surely be allowed to spread nationally.

We are calling out these dangerous ideas and gross misconceptions and asking voters to take a stand against them.

Thank you. I would like to now turn it over to [3rd speaker]

Speaker #3

Thank you XXXX, and as mentioned, I am XXXX.

Before Donald Trump was even thinking about running for President, Chris Christie was writing the book on squeezing teachers and hurting working families here in New Jersey.

Just this week, he vetoed an equal pay bill that would have helped women breadwinners in our state. I couldn't believe it he suggested that teachers should be making minimum wage last year.

And let's face it, the teaching profession is a woman-dominated one and issues around equal pay and the minimum wage affect working women and their families. So when Governor Christie says those horrible things about teachers and suggests inflicting violence on teachers' unions, he is targeting a lot of New Jersey women.

At the national level, Trump and the rest of the Republican Party share those values. With Trump as the face of the Republican party, we expect to hear a lot more divisive, wrong-headed rhetoric, and unfortunately, more hostility toward educators.

Trump and Christie are cut from the same cloth. New Jersey is well aware of Christie's bullying tactics, reneging on promises made at the negotiation table, slashing funding for state education. And all indicators suggest that Trump will be worse on the national level.

Thank you.

** Jon Stewart on HBO before election day?
------------------------------------------------------------
Numerous media critics have bemoaned Jon Stewart's absence from the airwav=
es this election season. Stewart has an HBO deal -- so will we see him on=
 HBO NOW between now and election day? That's what I asked HBO CEO Richard=
 Plepler during an on-stage interview at the Paley Center this afternoon.=
 Plepler's answer: "Yeah=2C I=E2=80=99m hopeful."

But he said Stewart isn't "clamoring at the bit" to get back on TV just to=
 speak his mind about Donald Trump: "I think he=E2=80=99s clamoring at the=
 bit to do something that he knows is going to stand out and be a new part=
 of his artistic expression." (Stewart is expected to start by producing s=
hort=2C animated web video shows.)

Plepler said "he has free rein to do whatever he wants." That was the exec=
's theme this afternoon -- nurturing and supporting talent. Read a recap o=
f Plepler's comments at The Wrap (<<link>>
pler-hopeful-that-jon-stewart-will-be-on-air-by-presidential-election-vide=
o/) and watch the full video on YouTube here... (<<link>>

Stewart's Trump joke tonight...
Via CNN WH producer Kevin Liptak: Stewart hosted an event at Joint Base An=
drews tonight marking the 75th birthday of the USO. Obama and Biden were t=
here... And when Stewart was introducing Biden=2C he said this:

Biden "is always a guy that we had a lot of fun with because he's a guy th=
at's unpredictable. He'll say whatever he kind of thinks of=2C whatever co=
mes to his mind=2C he's impulsive. Sometimes you might think to yourself=
=2C 'That sounds crazy=2C' or 'Man=2C that is crazy.' And who would have t=
hought that now that gets you the Republican nomination."  [] "=
Don't worry=2C Trump's going to keep you busy when he's commander-in-chief=
=2E You're going to have to repaint all the planes with Trump in big gold le=
tters. You're going to be busy."
Sumner Redstone trial starts Friday
Dylan Byers reports: (<<link>>
e-deposed-trial-preview/index.html?iid=3DLead)  Sumner Redstone=2C 92=2C w=
as videotaped taking questions from lawyers at his Beverly Park mansion to=
day -- and the footage will be used as evidence in the contentious legal b=
attle over his mental competency. The trial starts Friday (<<link>>
n.com/2016/05/05/media/sumner-redstone-deposed-trial-preview/index.html?ii=
d=3DLead) in L.A. County Superior Court=2C and we'll have full coverage. T=
he public and the press will not see the tape=2C but the court will provid=
e a transcript...

-- Context: For Manuela Herzer=2C Redstone's 51-year-old former girlfriend=
 who brought the domain.com=2C the tape could help prove that Redstone was no=
t of sound mind when he booted her from his mansion last fall and signed a=
n order revoking her authority over his healthcare decisions. But the verd=
ict will affect more than Herzer. If Redstone is found to be incompetent=
=2C it could open the door for a power struggle at both domain.com and CBS. Re=
ad Dylan's full story here... (<<link>>

Claims of elder abuse?
Today Fortune published a three-parter (<<link>>
-part-1/) -- "The Disturbing Decline of Sumner Redstone" -- with this news=
 nugget: "Redstone=E2=80=99s lawyers are planning to intensify the legal c=
onflict even more. The lawyers confirm they will soon file a new domain.com agai=
nst Herzer" and another Redstone ex=2C Sydney Holland=2C "claiming elder a=
buse=2C among other things=2C and seeking to reclaim nearly $150 million t=
hat the billionaire gave these women in recent years." Lawyers for Holland=
 and Herzer have denied any misconduct. More... (<<link>>

Are you surprised it lasted this long?
New newspaper survives for only 10 weeks
Alanna Petroff reports from London: (<<link>>
/newspaper-new-day-uk/index.html?iid=3DSF_LN)  "British media company Trin=
ity Mirror is killing off national daily New Day after just 10 weeks in pr=
int." The paper sold for =C2=A30.50 ($0.73)=2C "hoped to appeal to women b=
etween the ages of 35 to 55 and promised to be 'politically neutral.' Howe=
ver=2C there weren't enough sales to keep it going. The paper only attract=
ed roughly 40=2C000 readers." Read more and feign surprise... (<<link>>
domain.com/2016/05/05/media/newspaper-new-day-uk/index.html?iid=3DSF_LN)

-- Editor Alison Phillips wrote on Facebook: "We have tried everything we=
 could but sadly we just haven't reached the sales figures we needed to ma=
ke it work financially..."
A recipe for success?
Gerry Smith says "It's all the food that=E2=80=99s fit to eat." He had the=
 scoop (<<link>>
o-start-delivering-meal-kits-to-your-home) on today's strangest media stor=
y: the NYT getting into the food delivery biz through a partnership with C=
hef'd.

CNNMoney's Sara Ashley O'Brien describes it this way: (<<link>>
m/2016/05/05/technology/new-york-times-startup-chefd/index.html)  The NYT=
 will provide the recipes and "Chef'd will take care of ingredients=2C del=
ivery and logistics." This will start in the summer... With just a "handfu=
l" of the paper's 17=2C000+ recipes to start...
"The flagship show of Fox News"
Michael Moore sure knows how to troll Bill O'Reilly. He returned to Megyn=
 Kelly's show tonight and -- both in a tweet beforehand=2C and again on th=
e air during the interview -- called "The Kelly File" the "flagship show o=
f Fox News." Really=2C that title belongs to "The O'Reilly Factor=2C" but=
 I digress. At the end of the highly entertaining segment=2C Moore compare=
d Kelly to LeBron James=2C calling her a "free agent" and noting her loomi=
ng contract talks. Maybe=2C he said=2C she'll leave for ABC?

"You know more than I do=2C" she responded.

Before saying goodbye=2C Moore joked that an EMT was on the way to Roger A=
iles' office. "Roger=2C I'm just kidding!" he said. "She's staying!"
Road to 2015 
Interview of the day
CNN's Jake Tapper had the most news-making interview of the day. His exclu=
sive interview with Paul Ryan has generated hundreds of news stories since=
 4pm. Here's the transcript (<<link>>
ranscript-donald-trump-endorsement/)  of Ryan saying that he's "just not r=
eady" to support Donald Trump. All the network nightly newscasts=2C includ=
ing NBC=2C pictured above=2C showed portions of the interview. "Ryan's pos=
ition makes him the highest-level GOP official to reject Trump=2C" Eric Br=
adner notes... (<<link>>

Trump "wishes there were more" debates
There was lots of talk about the Hispanic Vote today thanks to Trump's Cin=
co de Mayo feast. "I love Hispanics!" (<<link>>
ics/donald-trump-taco-bowl-cinco-de-mayo/index.html) he tweeted. But what=
 about the all-important Network TV Executive Vote? Trump loves them=2C to=
o. Consider what he told CNBC today about wanting more televised debates d=
uring the general election.

CNBC's summary of the interview: (<<link>>
ump-a-chance-ill-pick-a-vp-from-field-of-former-gop-candidates.html) "Trum=
p said he looks forward to the general election debates. With three on the=
 schedule=2C he said he wishes there were more." (Do you believe him?)
"Sure he'd die on their show"
Peggy Noonan has a theory about TV's Trump predilection during the primari=
es:  (<<link>>

 ratings=2C it was something else. It was the freak show at its zenith=2C=
 it was great TV=E2=80=94you didn=E2=80=99t know what he was going to say=
 next! He didn't know! It was better than everyone else's boring=2C prefab=
ricated=2C airless=2C weightless=2C relentless word-saying=E2=80=A6"

"And it was something else. TV producers were all sure he'd die on their s=
how. They weren't for Mr. Trump. By showing him they were revealing him: L=
ook at this fatuous dope=2C see through him! They knew he=E2=80=99d quickl=
y enough say something unforgivable=2C and if he said it on their air he d=
ied on their show! They took him down with the question! It was only after=
 a solid six months of his not dying that they came to have qualms. They n=
ow understood they were helping him..."

I think most TV producers would say they were covering an important story.=

pples and oranges. But YouTube's goal is to shift more ad spending from TV=
 to the web. Video: Here's what Wojcicki told me when we sat down recently=
