Dear Mesfer



I need you to clarify the following regarding the attached document.



1.      
Is the stamp on the document for the tax authority in Italy or for HT.
2.      
If it is for the tax authority then document B will not be needed but the form needs attestation from the embassy. We should have
 the original document.
3.      
HT should stamp its part of the document as well.



Regards,



Ali

Dear Mesfer



DZIT rules for refunding WT is as follows:



1-     
The based paying entity (TCC) required  to deduct shall have to deduct the tax and pay back to the Department according to provisions and prices provided in the Tax Law.



2-     
If the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements entered into with the Kingdom shall grant the beneficiary (Hacking Team) an exemption or discount in relation to the deduction
 tax stipulated in the Tax Law, the deducting entity (TCC) shall have to provide the Department of Zakat and Income Tax a letter requires therein to refund the deducted overpaid amount provided, the letter should be attached by the following:



A.     
A letter from the beneficiary (Hacking Team) based in the other country requesting therein to refund the overpaid amounts.

B.     
A certificate issued by the Tax Department of such country wherein the beneficiary (Hacking Team) is residing, stating that, the beneficiary of the paid amount is residing
 under the provisions of article four of the agreement with such country, and that the amount paid thereto shall be taxable in its country.

C.     
A copy of the deduction form whereby, the tax was provided along with the receipt that approves the payment by the deducting entity to the Department of Zakat& Tax Income.



3. After the above mentioned is received and the paying person (Hacking Team) is verified to enjoy the conditions
 stated in the agreement so as to get domain.com from the provisions of the agreement, the Department shall refund the overpaid amount according to the procedures stated in the Department Circulation No. 3334/9, dated 16/06/1427 H.



To clarify more :



1.      
TCC deducted 15% from HT payments. The agreement Between Italy and Saudi Arabia allows 10% deduction instead of 15%. Therefore HT is eligible to claim refund of 5% only
 not the full 15% that was deducted.

2.      
In addition to the form provided in your email, HT is required to domain.com the documents A, B, and C . (All the above documents A, B, and C are preferably to be authenticated
 by the embassy)

Ali
