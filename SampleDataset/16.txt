** Jon Stewart on HBO before election day?
------------------------------------------------------------
Numerous media critics have bemoaned Jon Stewart's absence from the airwav=
es this election season. Stewart has an HBO deal -- so will we see him on=
 HBO NOW between now and election day? That's what I asked HBO CEO Richard=
 Plepler during an on-stage interview at the Paley Center this afternoon.=
 Plepler's answer: "Yeah=2C I=E2=80=99m hopeful."

But he said Stewart isn't "clamoring at the bit" to get back on TV just to=
 speak his mind about Donald Trump: "I think he=E2=80=99s clamoring at the=
 bit to do something that he knows is going to stand out and be a new part=
 of his artistic expression." (Stewart is expected to start by producing s=
hort=2C animated web video shows.)

Plepler said "he has free rein to do whatever he wants." That was the exec=
's theme this afternoon -- nurturing and supporting talent. Read a recap o=
f Plepler's comments at The Wrap (<<link>>
pler-hopeful-that-jon-stewart-will-be-on-air-by-presidential-election-vide=
o/) and watch the full video on YouTube here... (<<link>>

Stewart's Trump joke tonight...
Via CNN WH producer Kevin Liptak: Stewart hosted an event at Joint Base An=
drews tonight marking the 75th birthday of the USO. Obama and Biden were t=
here... And when Stewart was introducing Biden=2C he said this:

Biden "is always a guy that we had a lot of fun with because he's a guy th=
at's unpredictable. He'll say whatever he kind of thinks of=2C whatever co=
mes to his mind=2C he's impulsive. Sometimes you might think to yourself=
=2C 'That sounds crazy=2C' or 'Man=2C that is crazy.' And who would have t=
hought that now that gets you the Republican nomination."  [] "=
Don't worry=2C Trump's going to keep you busy when he's commander-in-chief=
=2E You're going to have to repaint all the planes with Trump in big gold le=
tters. You're going to be busy."
Sumner Redstone trial starts Friday
Dylan Byers reports: (<<link>>
e-deposed-trial-preview/index.html?iid=3DLead)  Sumner Redstone=2C 92=2C w=
as videotaped taking questions from lawyers at his Beverly Park mansion to=
day -- and the footage will be used as evidence in the contentious legal b=
attle over his mental competency. The trial starts Friday (<<link>>
n.com/2016/05/05/media/sumner-redstone-deposed-trial-preview/index.html?ii=

he public and the press will not see the tape=2C but the court will provid=
e a transcript...

-- Context: For Manuela Herzer=2C Redstone's 51-year-old former girlfriend=
 who brought the domain.com=2C the tape could help prove that Redstone was no=
t of sound mind when he booted her from his mansion last fall and signed a=
n order revoking her authority over his healthcare decisions. But the verd=
ict will affect more than Herzer. If Redstone is found to be incompetent=
=2C it could open the door for a power struggle at both domain.com and CBS. Re=

Claims of elder abuse?
Today Fortune published a three-parter (<<link>>

New newspaper survives for only 10 weeks
Alanna Petroff reports from London: (<<link>>

int." The paper sold for =C2=A30.50 ($0.73)=2C "hoped to appeal to women b=

A recipe for success?
Gerry Smith says "It's all the food that=E2=80=99s fit to eat." He had the=
 scoop (<<link>>
o-start-delivering-meal-kits-to-your-home) on today's strangest media stor=
y: the NYT getting into the food delivery biz through a partnership with C=
hef'd.

CNNMoney's Sara Ashley O'Brien describes it this way: (<<link>>
m/2016/05/05/technology/new-york-times-startup-chefd/index.html)  The NYT=
 will provide the recipes and "Chef'd will take care of ingredients=2C del=
ivery and logistics." This will start in the summer... With just a "handfu=
l" of the paper's 17=2C000+ recipes to start...
"The flagship show of Fox News"
Michael Moore sure knows how to troll Bill O'Reilly. He returned to Megyn=
 Kelly's show tonight and -- both in a tweet beforehand=2C and again on th=
e air during the interview -- called "The Kelly File" the "flagship show o=
f Fox News." Really=2C that title belongs to "The O'Reilly Factor=2C" but=
 I digress. At the end of the highly entertaining segment=2C Moore compare=
d Kelly to LeBron James=2C calling her a "free agent" and noting her loomi=
ng contract talks. Maybe=2C he said=2C she'll leave for ABC?

"You know more than I do=2C" she responded.

Before saying goodbye=2C Moore joked that an EMT was on the way to Roger A=
iles' office. "Roger=2C I'm just kidding!" he said. "She's staying!"
Road to 2015 
Interview of the day
CNN's Jake Tapper had the most news-making interview of the day. His exclu=
sive interview with Paul Ryan has generated hundreds of news stories since=
 4pm. Here's the transcript (<<link>>

eady" to support Donald Trump. All the network nightly newscasts=2C includ=
ing NBC=2C pictured above=2C showed portions of the interview. "Ryan's pos=

Trump "wishes there were more" debates
There was lots of talk about the Hispanic Vote today thanks to Trump's Cin=
co de Mayo feast. "I love Hispanics!" (<<link>>
ics/donald-trump-taco-bowl-cinco-de-mayo/index.html) he tweeted. But what=
 about the all-important Network TV Executive Vote? Trump loves them=2C to=
o. Consider what he told CNBC today about wanting more televised debates d=
uring the general election.

CNBC's summary of the interview: (<<link>>
ump-a-chance-ill-pick-a-vp-from-field-of-former-gop-candidates.html) "Trum=
p said he looks forward to the general election debates. With three on the=
 schedule=2C he said he wishes there were more." (Do you believe him?)
"Sure he'd die on their show"
Peggy Noonan has a theory about TV's Trump predilection during the primari=
es:  (<<link>>

 ratings=2C it was something else. It was the freak show at its zenith=2C=

 next! He didn't know! It was better than everyone else's boring=2C prefab=
ricated=2C airless=2C weightless=2C relentless word-saying=E2=80=A6"

"And it was something else. TV producers were all sure he'd die on their s=
how. They weren't for Mr. Trump. By showing him they were revealing him: L=
ook at this fatuous dope=2C see through him! They knew he=E2=80=99d quickl=
y enough say something unforgivable=2C and if he said it on their air he d=
ied on their show! They took him down with the question! It was only after=
 a solid six months of his not dying that they came to have qualms. They n=
