U.S. President Barack Obama chided Vietnam on political freedoms on Tuesday=

one woman held a boy dressed in a Captain America costume, complete with sh=

Nearing the end of his presidency, President Obama is returning next week t=

aduation rates and health insurance coverage. "This progress is thanks to t=

 result of the choices we made as a nation." Elkhart had been hit harder by=
 the Great Recession than almost anywhere in America, prompting Obama to pr=

Reeling From 2016 Chaos, G.O.P. Mulls Overhaul of Primaries<http://www.nyti=

NEW YORK TIMES // JEREMY PETERS

Leaders of the Republican Party have begun internal deliberations over what=
 would be fundamental changes to the way its presidential nominees are chos=
en, a recognition that the chaotic process that played out this year is ser=
iously flawed and helped exacerbate tensions within the party. In a signifi=
cant shift, Republican officials said it now seemed unlikely that the four =
states to vote first would all retain their cherished place on the electora=
l calendar, with Nevada as the most probable casualty. Party leaders are ev=
en going so far as to consider diluting the traditional status of Iowa, New=
 Hampshire and South Carolina as gatekeepers to the presidency. Under one p=
roposal, those states would be paired with others that vote on the same day=
 as a way to give more voters a meaningful role much sooner. But in a move =
that would sharply limit who can participate in presidential primaries, man=
y party activists are also pushing to close Republican contests to independ=
ent voters, arguing that open primaries in some states allowed Donald J. Tr=
ump, whose conservative convictions they deeply mistrust, to become the pre=
sumptive nominee.

 pockets?" Clinton added on Tuesday afternoon in one of a series of tweets.=
 "We need a president who's fighting to raise incomes for all Americans, no=

 ad noting that millions of Americans lost their homes and jobs as a result=
 of the housing market crash in 2008. The ad included audio of Trump from 2=

 then people like me would go in and buy," Trump said in the 2006 audiobook=

Hillary Clinton's campaign team and her allies don't expect Donald Trump to=

In 1987, Timothy Tyrone Foster, an 18-year-old black man from Georgia, was =
convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a 79-year-old white woma=

e ruling sends the case back to the Georgia courts, where the state may cho=
ose to retry Mr. Foster. This was clearly the correct result. The prosecuto=
rs in Mr. Foster's case kept notes that served as a remarkably explicit roa=

through a state open-records law. Before then, the prosecutors got away wit=

The corporate tax mess: Our view<http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016=

USA TODAY // THE EDITORIAL BOARD

The U.S. corporate tax system is an unholy mess. This is evident in the pil=
es of cash that U.S. companies hoard overseas, where it is not subject to t=
he punitively high 35% American corporate tax rate. USA TODAY reported Mond=
ay that five top tech companies alone - Alphabet, Apple, Cisco Systems, Mic=
rosoft and Oracle - collectively held $504 billion in cash at the end of la=
st year, 87.5% of which was parked abroad. That money is earning paltry amo=
unts of interest rather than being reinvested in America or given to shareh=
olders in the form of dividends. The mess is also evident in so-called corp=
orate inversions, a favored ruse whereby a U.S.-based company buys a smalle=
r overseas company and claims its country (with its lower tax rates) as its=
 new corporate home. This spring, the Treasury Department reworked its rule=
s to thwart a plan by drug-maker Pfizer to purchase Allergan and move its i=
ncorporation to Ireland.

s people from registering to vote and casting ballots on the same day illeg=
ally discriminates against black voters, a federal judge
 ruled on Tuesday, ordering a crucial swing state to change its rules befor=
e the fall elections. Democrats had challenged the law, describing it as on=
e in a long series that Republicans in several states had enacted to suppre=
ss voting by blacks and Hispanics,
 who are more likely than others to vote early and to vote Democratic. Repu=
blicans denied that charge, saying the law combated voter fraud. Judge Mich=
ael H. Watson, of Federal District Court in Cincinnati, wrote in his findin=
gs that voter fraud was very rare
 and that the law did nothing to prevent it. It is unclear what effect the =
ruling will have on turnout. Republicans would not say immediately whether =
they would appeal, but they noted that even with the provision the judge st=
ruck down, Ohio had one of the longest
 early voting periods in the United States, starting four weeks before an e=
lection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 California, the nation&#8217;s most populous state, would be a lustrous pr=

 supporters in Anaheim, California, ripping into The Walt Disney Company, o=

 an unjustly rigged economy. Much as he has
 with his frequent invocations of Wal-Mart as an example of a rigged econom=

 start off and be very blunt. We&#8217;re here in Anaheim. Everybody knows =
the major economic force here in Anaheim is
 the Disney corporation. Anybody here work for Disney?&quot; Sanders asked.=
 The crowd cheered. Sanders then asked, &quot;Anybody here making a living =

t; Sanders then boasted, &quot;I&#8217;m probably the only politician
 to come to Anaheim and say this. I use Disney not to pick on Disney but as=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In 1987, Timothy Tyrone Foster, an 18-year-old bla=
ck man from Georgia, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of=
 a 79-year-old white woman named Queen Madge White. On Monday,
 the Supreme Court invalidated Mr. Foster&#8217;s conviction and sentence b=
ecause prosecutors had struck every black prospective juror at his trial &#=
8212; a violation of his constitutional rights. The ruling sends the case b=
ack to the Georgia courts, where the state may
 choose to retry Mr. Foster. This was clearly the correct result. The prose=
cutors in Mr. Foster&#8217;s case kept notes that served as a remarkably ex=
plicit road map of how to discriminate in jury selection. For example, they=
 highlighted the names of black prospective
 jurors on one list with a &#8220;B&#8221; and, on another list, ranked the=
m against one another, in case &#8220;it comes down to having to pick one o=
f the black jurors.&#8221; Those notes were locked away in prosecution file=
s for nearly 20 years, until lawyers for Mr. Foster obtained
 them through a state open-records law. Before then, the prosecutors got aw=
ay with lying about their motivations thanks to Georgia courts that looked =
the other way. Even after the notes were revealed, prosecutors continued to=
 concoct far-fetched explanations
 for their behavior.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Donald Trump is famous for his flights of politica=
l exaggeration, but every so often he lands on the truth. Witness his claim=
 to the National Rifle Association on Friday that &#8220;the Second
 Amendment is on the ballot in November&#8221; and that Hillary Clinton &#8=
220;wants to abolish the Second Amendment.&#8221; This has offended Mrs. Cl=
inton&#8217;s media bodyguards who claim she merely favors background check=
s and minor regulation. Mrs. Clinton took to Twitter to
 claim that Mr. Trump is &#8220;wrong,&#8221; and &#8220;We can uphold Seco=
nd Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.&#8221; Let&#82=
17;s go to the audiotape. If Mrs. Clinton &#8220;gets to appoint her judges=
, she will as part of it abolish the Second Amendment,&#8221; Mr. Trump tol=
d
 the NRA. He added that Mrs. Clinton had rebuked the Supreme Court for its =
2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller establishing that the Secon=
d Amendment included an individual right to bear arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p=

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Industrial Chemicals are in countless products, bu=
t the government&#8217;s system to ensure they are safe is broken, and has =
been for decades. The past few years showed why fixing it has
 been so hard: As some members of Congress attempted to negotiate bipartisa=
n reforms, others made the perfect &#8212; or the perfectly political &#821=
2; the enemy of the good. This impasse looks as though it&#8217;s about to =
end, at long last, as Congress considers a bipartisan
 chemical safety reform bill this week. On its merits, the Frank R. Lautenb=
erg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act should pass by acclamation. Un=
der current law, the Environmental Protection Agency is hobbled in all sort=
s of dangerous ways. The agency
 cannot subject chemicals to safety testing without evidence that they are =
potentially risky &#8212; which is hard to obtain without testing. Conseque=
ntly, the EPA has managed to examine a mere 200 chemicals since 1976, thoug=
h thousands are produced and sold every
 year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The U.S. corporate tax system is an unholy mess. T=
his is evident in the piles of cash that U.S. companies hoard overseas, whe=
re it is not subject to the punitively high 35% American
 corporate tax rate. USA TODAY reported Monday that five top tech companies=
 alone &#8212; Alphabet, Apple, Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Oracle &#8212;=
 collectively held $504 billion in cash at the end of last year, 87.5% of w=
hich was parked abroad. That money is earning
 paltry amounts of interest rather than being reinvested in America or give=
n to shareholders in the form of dividends. The mess is also evident in so-=
called corporate inversions, a favored ruse whereby a U.S.-based company bu=
ys a smaller overseas company and
 claims its country (with its lower tax rates) as its new corporate home. T=
his spring, the Treasury Department reworked its rules to thwart a plan by =
drug-maker Pfizer to purchase Allergan and move its incorporation to Irelan=
d.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
