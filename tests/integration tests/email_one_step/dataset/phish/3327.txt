Hi folks =97 A few of these to send from the First Lady later next week. Le=
t me know if you have any flags, and thanks.

It=92s graduation season, NAME. These past few weeks, students from all ove=
r the country have had a chance to celebrate their accomplishments and refl=
ect back on how far they=92ve come over the last few years. This year, Bara=
ck gave the commencement address at Howard University, right here in D.C. H=
e joked that he really felt old, realizing the young people receiving their=
 diplomas that day were just starting high school when he first became Pres=
ident.

That=92s pretty incredible to think about. We have come so far these past s=
even and a half years, and so much of that work was on behalf of these youn=
g people who are going out into the world. From immediate concerns like hea=
lth insurance to student loan repayment, to bigger picture issues like the =
threat of climate change, just look at how far we=92ve come.

And NAME, we wouldn=92t have gotten here without the support of folks like =
you each step of the way. I=92m truly in awe of all that we accomplished to=
gether, but I=92m also mindful of all the what remains to be done. So if yo=
u can, pitch in $10 or more today to help make sure we can build on this by=
 electing Democrats who share our vision for a brighter future for all Amer=
icans:

Thank you for all you do and the part you=92ve played in this progress. Hav=
ing you standing here with us means more than I can say.

Michelle

[Alt for Mother=92s Day card signers: P.S. =97 NAME, your warm wishes on Mo=
ther=92s Day meant so much to me. Thank you for signing my card.]

FRIEND --

It really means a lot whenever you support the party we all share -- whethe=
r you=92re volunteering your time, signing your name to a petition, or <LIN=
K>chipping in a few bucks when you can to help elect Democrats.<LINK>

With XXX days left between now and Election Day, Barack and our Democratic =
candidates need every bit of your support -- because we know that those day=
s will go by faster than you or I can imagine.

So today, I=92m reaching out to ask you for your help [ALT FOR DONORS: AGAI=
N]. Can I count on you to pitch in $10 or more to support Democrats?

LINKS

As always, NAME, thank you.

Michelle

[ALT FOR MOTHER=92S DAY CARD SIGNERS: P.S. -- NAME, I also want to take a m=
oment to thank you for all of your warm wishes on Mother=92s Day. It really=
 meant so much to hear from you.]

Friend --

We=92re headed into the part of any election that Barack likes to call "sil=
ly season."

But through all the distractions, I hope you never forget that we're fighti=
ng for the American dream. We're fighting to make sure that every single pe=
rson in this country has the opportunity to succeed. And nothing can take a=
way from just how meaningful that work us.

The next major fundraising deadline of this election is coming up in just a=
 few days. I hope I can count on you to pitch in $10 or whatever you can be=
fore then to help finish what we started together.

Thank you so much.
