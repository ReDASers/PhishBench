SL: Guidance for events around Trump-Ryan meeting in DC this week.

Body:

Overview / Event Guide

This week, Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are coming together in Washington D.C. for a highly-anticipated meeting. The Republican Party's highest-ranking elected official and their party's standard bearer may have some personal disagreements, but they both share the same agenda: cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, opposing measures like equal pay and paid family leave, attacking women's health, and holding up comprehensive immigration reform, among others.

We're asking state party communications directors to put together events around the Trump-Ryan meeting to deliver the following message: that Trump is not a moderate and he is not engaging in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. His extreme rhetoric and dangerous policies are in line with what Republicans in Washington have been pushing for years. We're also asking state party communications directors to echo these events with op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers, and surrogates on television and radio.

In this packet you'll find:

*         Sample talking points / message guidance

*         A sample advisory

*         A sample press release

*         A sample op-ed

*         Four sample letters to the editor
Organizationcan offer national surrogates to appear via satellite or phone on local television and radio broadcasts to amplify the message. Please reach out to user@domain<user@domain> if you would like to book one of our surrogates. Members of Congress and Senators who are currently in Washington can also use our studio to do local hits.

Here's what we're looking for in terms of event logistics:

*         Types of speakers:

o   State Party Chairs, Vice-Chairs, and EDs

o   Local Elected Officials

o   Allied Groups - Planned Parenthood, NAACP, Mi Familia Vota, etc.

o   Labor

o   People sharing personal stories

*         About 15-20 supporters

*         Signs that say "Reject the Trump-Ryan Agenda" - we have a mockup that can be found here<Trump-Ryan-Sign.pdf>.

*         A big push to get local TV to the event - studies show that local TV is the dominant player in most markets and Americans trust local TV news about 20 points more than they trust national TV news.

General Talking Points:

*         For years, GOP leaders have pushed a cynical and feckless political strategy that obstructs any kind of progress and exploits unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain.

*         They have sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America's middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top.

*         Donald Trump's victory is the ultimate, sad culmination of the success of that strategy. Trump is not engaging in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. Trump is the modern Republican Party.

Trump / Ryan on Taxes:

*         Trump's reckless tax plan would reward those at the top<<<link>>> by slashing the top income tax rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent

*         That would give<<<link>>> the "top 0.1% of income earners like himself an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million

*         Trump also plans to substantially<<<link>>> reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, instead of fixing tax loopholes that allow some large companies to pay no federal income tax at all

*         Trump's tax plan isn't anything new - it's the same proposal put forth by Republicans in Congress who want to cut<<<link>>#.VzCi6oQrK70> the top tax rate to 25 percent. Paul Ryan and his colleagues would also cut corporate taxes down to 25 percent - making Trump's 15 percent plan even more extreme.

*         Trickle-down economics simply doesn't work. The last two times Republicans implemented this agenda, our country was left mired in recession and facing massive deficits. Not only does trickle-down economics slow down the economy, but it means we won't have the money to pay for things like education and infrastructure and health care

Trump/Ryan on Debt:

*         For years, Republicans in Congress threatened the full faith and domain of the United States and threatened to breach the debt ceiling, leading one domain rating agency to remark<<<link>>> that any protracted fight over the issue could endanger America's domain rating.

*         Trump agrees that the United States should consider<<<link>>#ixzz48AeHAolA> playing fast and loose with our nation's finances, even calling himself "the king of debt."

*         He also said, "you never have to default because you print the money." Such reckless positions, if implemented, could threaten America's standing in the world and lead to chaos in the global financial markets.

*         We saw what happened the last time a Republican president came in and made a mess of the economy. We have come too far since the Great Recession to hand the keys to the economy over to the folks who crashed it in the first place.

*         In conclusion, Donald Trump's reckless tax policies and his suggestion that we should play chicken with the country's finances are lifted directly from the same old failed Republican playbook. Trump can ignore reality and crown himself the "king of debt," but it's clear that his economic ideas, and those of his fellow Republicans are simply bankrupt. The American people and our economy can't afford a disastrous Trump presidency.

Trump/Ryan on women's health:

*         This week marks women's health week.

*         A few weeks ago, Donald Trump said that he wanted to "punish" women who get abortions.

*         Paul Ryan and House Republicans are already implementing Trump's agenda to punish women.

*         Paul Ryan has wasted the American people's time, money, and patience with a partisan investigation of Planned Parenthood

*         Both Paul Ryan and Donald Trump want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would mean that:

o   Women could be charged more than a man for the same health care plan

o   We would go back to the days when pregnancy and domestic violence could be considered pre-existing conditions

o   Women would go back to paying out-of-pocket for birth control

*         Trump thinks ensuring equal pay for women should just be left up to "the marketplace" and once suggested family leave policies should actually be scaled back and noted pregnancy was "an inconvenience for a business." Trump complained that when he employed mothers, they were not giving him "100 percent."

Trump/Ryan on immigration reform:

*         Trump's dangerous proposals and inflammatory rhetoric on immigration didn't come from nowhere.

*         Before Trump came along, Republicans in Congress were holding up immigration reform, suing the President for prioritizing the deportation of criminals over families, and stoking fear of immigrants.

*         Democrats, by contrast, support comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.

*         Immigration reform is not just the right thing to do - it reduces the domain and helps to create jobs. In fact the Congressional Budget Office found that the immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but got blocked by Republicans in the House would reduce the federal domain by $175 billion in the first ten years.
