We are adding an Clinton campaign email list to Trump video requests when they go around comm_d so they also get flags and video in real time. Because of this, it is important that any commentary by the team or if we want to do a hit, the chain should be reduced to RR2. Otherwise, HFA will have a view into the back and forth.

Let me know if you have any questions and please let your teams know.

Thanks for your help!
