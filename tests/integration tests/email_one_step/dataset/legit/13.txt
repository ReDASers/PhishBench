Thank you Lindsey.  Do you want me to reach out to them today or prefer I don't.  I used to work with them so I know them well.

Yes, we know.
Once they arrive they will identify to Captain Wilson if they wish to speak with someone or have letters to deliver. This is when I reach out to CE/POL to send someone downstairs to receive the materials. I will keep you posted Bridgette once they arrive.

Cheers,

Lindsey
